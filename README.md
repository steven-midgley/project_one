## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we present statistical summaries and visualizations derived from the flight behavior data. These insights help us understand key performance indicators related to flight operations.

### Key Insights from Flight Data

- **Overall Delay Trends:** Most flights experience minimal delays, but certain airlines and airports show consistently higher delays.
- **Airline Performance:** Frontier Airlines and AirTran Airways were identified as underperforming in terms of on-time arrivals, while Alaska Airlines consistently arrives early.
- **Airport Efficiency:** Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) had the highest average delays, while smaller regional airports tended to perform better.
- **Time-Based Delays:** Flights scheduled during late-night hours (12 AM to 3 AM) and afternoon peak times (5 PM to 7 PM) were more likely to be delayed.
- **Correlation Findings:** Distance and flight time showed weak correlations with delays, indicating that other factors (such as weather or operational inefficiencies) are likely contributing to delays.

## Visualizations

### Visualization 1: **Arrival Delay Distribution**

![Arrival Delay Distribution](images/arrival_delay_distribution.png)

**Explanation**: This histogram visualizes the distribution of arrival delays. The majority of flights experience delays ranging from 0 to 10 minutes. However, the right skew shows that there are some extreme outliers with significant delays, though they are less frequent.

### Visualization 2: **Average Delays by Airline**

![Average Delays by Airline](images/average_delays_by_airline.png)

**Explanation**: This bar chart shows the average delay times for each airline. Airlines like Frontier and AirTran tend to have longer delays on average, while Alaska Airlines stands out with consistently shorter delays. These differences suggest potential operational inefficiencies in certain airlines.

### Visualization 3: **Delays by Origin Airport**

![Delays by Origin Airport](images/delays_by_origin_airport.png)

**Explanation**: This bar chart analyzes delays based on the originating airport. Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) has the longest delays, while smaller airports tend to have shorter delays. This could be due to larger airports dealing with more air traffic and congestion.

### Visualization 4: **Delays by Destination Airport**

![Delays by Destination Airport](images/delays_by_destination_airport.png)

**Explanation**: Similar to origin airports, this chart highlights destination airports with significant delays. Newark (EWR) once again stands out as one of the most delay-prone airports. This indicates that both departure and arrival at busy airports can contribute to flight delays.

### Visualization 5: **Correlation Between Delays and Other Variables (Heatmap)**

![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_heatmap.png)

**Explanation**: This heatmap shows the correlation between various flight characteristics (such as distance, flight time, and delays). While there is a weak positive correlation between flight distance and delays, other variables like flight time show minimal correlation with delay times.

### Visualization 6: **Delays by Hour of the Day**

![Delays by Hour](images/delays_by_hour.png)

**Explanation**: This time-series chart shows how delays vary throughout the day. Early morning flights have the fewest delays, while late afternoon and night flights tend to face higher delays. This suggests that congestion builds up over the course of the day, leading to more delays later on.

### Visualization 7: **Delays by Day of the Week**

![Delays by Day](images/delays_by_day.png)

**Explanation**: This bar chart reveals how delays differ across the days of the week. Thursday experiences the highest delays, possibly due to higher traffic volume, while weekends tend to have fewer delays overall.

- **Recommendation:**

1. **Operational Improvements for Airlines**:

   - Airlines with consistently high delays, such as Frontier and AirTran Airways, should consider reviewing their scheduling and resource allocation strategies to reduce delays. Improving staff scheduling and aircraft turnaround times may help alleviate delays.

2. **Airport Congestion Management**:

   - Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) faces significant delays. Airport management should consider implementing congestion management strategies, such as optimizing runway schedules or improving coordination between airlines to reduce bottlenecks.

3. **Focus on Late-Night Flights**:

   - Given that late-night flights experience higher delays, airlines and airports should allocate additional resources during these peak periods to handle potential issues before they escalate.

4. **Increased Resources During Busy Travel Days**:
   - Since Thursdays consistently show higher delays, airports should consider increasing staffing or resources during peak travel days to handle higher traffic volumes and minimize delays.

## Interactive Map Features

The project includes an interactive map that dynamically displays flight paths and other flight data. The map is generated using Folium and Flask, allowing users to explore different aspects of the dataset.

### **Features:**

1. **Dynamic Map Creation:**

- Maps are generated dynamically on-demand based on flight data from the flight_states.csv file.
- The map renders flight paths and uses markers and polylines to represent flight categories and paths.
- Flight markers are color-coded based on aircraft categories.

2. **Routes in Flask:**

- **/:** Home page where users can run Python code via Pyodide.
- **/all_crafts:** Generates a map of all tracked flights and renders it dynamically on a separate HTML page.
- **/icao24_flight_path:** Generates specific flight paths using Folium and the flight's icao24 code.

3. **Deployment:**

- The web app is deployed on a DigitalOcean Droplet, allowing for a serverless experience. All code is run through Flask, served via Gunicorn, and dynamically renders the maps without any hardcoded HTML.

4. **Real-Time Data Handling:**

- The app dynamically reads flight data (from CSV) and feeds it into the map to reflect real-time or pre-recorded flight paths.

5. **Automation:**

- A script automatically converts Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) to Python scripts (.py), allowing for seamless integration with the Flask app. The script can be found at notebooks/scripts/ipynb_script_converter.py.

## Results and Insights

- **Overall Delay Trends**: The majority of flights experience minimal delays, though extreme delays (outliers) can heavily influence the average delay time.
- **Airline Performance**: Airlines such as Frontier and AirTran Airways show consistently higher delays, while Alaska Airlines performs better with significantly fewer delays.
- **Airport Efficiency**: Larger airports like Newark Liberty International (EWR) experience the most delays, while smaller regional airports tend to perform better.
- **Time-Based Delays**: Early morning flights are generally on time, while late-night flights and weekday flights (especially Thursdays) face higher delays.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Weak correlations between delays and variables such as flight distance and air time suggest that other factors (e.g., operational inefficiencies or weather conditions) are more likely contributors to delays.

## Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis of flight delays has provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to delays. While many flights experience only minimal delays, certain airlines and airports consistently underperform. Larger airports like Newark Liberty (EWR) and airlines such as Frontier and AirTran Airways show significant opportunities for operational improvements.

Further research could incorporate external factors, such as weather conditions or seasonal trends, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of delay causes. By implementing the recommendations derived from this analysis, airlines and airports can work toward reducing delays, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Future Work:

- **Incorporating Weather Data**: Adding weather data could help better explain delays related to specific environmental factors.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Analyzing data across different seasons or holidays could reveal additional trends in flight delays.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building a predictive model to forecast delays based on the findings from this analysis could further optimize airline and airport operations.

  - Before merging into `main`, ensure your feature branch is up to date with the latest changes from `main`.

    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    git pull origin main
    ```

- **Merge your branch into `main`**:

  - Once your branch is tested and ready, merge it into the `main` branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge <branch-name>
    git push origin main
    ```

- **Resolve any merge conflicts**:
  - If you encounter any merge conflicts, resolve them manually and complete the merge.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Branch Discipline

- **Protected Branch:** `main` â€“ Managed by the project manager. No direct pushes are allowed to `main`. All code merged into `main` should be thoroughly tested and approved.
- **Testing Branch:** `stage` â€“ All feature branches and code contributions are merged into `stage` for testing. Once the `stage` branch is stable and conflict-free, it will be merged into `main`.

- **Feature Branches:** All new features, bug fixes, or updates must be developed in their own feature branches. These branches should be named descriptively based on the task (e.g., `feature/interactive-map` or `bugfix/api-errors`).

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

  ```

- **Pull Requests:** Code should be merged into stage or main through pull requests (PRs). PRs should include clear descriptions of the changes and any testing that has been done. Team members should review and approve the PR before it is merged.

- **Code Review Process:** Before merging into stage or main, the code should go through a review process to ensure it meets quality standards, contains proper documentation, and does not introduce any conflicts or issues.
